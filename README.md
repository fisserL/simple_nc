# Simple Network Coding in Python

This is a hobbyist demo of Network Coding on the binary field.  
The implementation sticks to native Python data types and tries to be as simple to understand as possible.  
Of course this will result in non-optimal performance, both in encoding and decoding.

You can try out the implementation by running the example `simplenc/examples/demo_network_coding.py` and playing around with the pre-set parameters.
