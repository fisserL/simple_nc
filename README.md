# Simple Network Coding in Python
[![CI](https://github.com/fisserL/simple_nc/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fisserL/simple_nc/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is a hobbyist demo of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) on the binary field.  
The implementation sticks to native Python data types and tries to be as simple to understand as possible.  
Of course this will result in non-optimal performance, both in encoding and decoding.

## Installation
Clone this repository and navigate to the project's root directory.  
Install using `pip install .`.

## Example
You can try out the implementation by running the example `simplenc/examples/demo_network_coding.py` and playing around with the pre-set parameters.
